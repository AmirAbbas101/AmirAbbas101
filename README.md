## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm Amir Abbas, a **fresh Computer Science graduate** from Pakistan 🇵🇰 with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through code.

I specialize in **backend development using Python and Django**, and I love building web applications that are not only functional, but also clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

I believe that software should serve a purpose, and every line of code should have meaning. Over the last year, I’ve worked on practical, real-world projects that simulate real business needs from building a job portal to deploying full-stack apps.

Now that I’ve graduated, I’m fully focused on **growing as a professional developer**, learning continuously, and contributing to teams that value quality, clarity, and collaboration.

> I don’t just build features. I build systems that last.
